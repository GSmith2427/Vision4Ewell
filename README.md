I collaborated on group projects for the Application Development course, where we built an app for the Ewell local council, expanding on earlier Database Development and UX/UI work to promote community unification. This experience improved my skills in project management, creating user stories, documentation, risk assessments, and applying SDLC (Waterfall and Agile). I discovered my strength in backend development, where I led tasks like database creation, API implementation, and UI/UX enhancements. Additionally, I set up Git repositories for version control.
